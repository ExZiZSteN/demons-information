                    <p>Demons are malevolent spiritual entities that are considered the direct opposites to angels.
                        They are created from human souls who have endured prolonged extreme torture in Hell. Via this process, they become corrupted, extremely evil, and also very powerful. Similar to Angels, they are spiritual entities and therefore require a vessel to fully interact with the physical world, though they are able to roam around in their smoke form.
                        The species as a whole functions as the series' primary antagonists and are the most recurring supernatural creatures.</p>

                        Demons are the result of human souls going to Hell and being tortured until no humanity is left in them, thus turning into demons - dark, malicious spirits that revel in pain, chaos, and death.
                        Most demons foget what it means to be human.Some have even forgotten that they were once human. In general, demons engage in torture and destruction because it is fun or to avoid being tortured themselves.
                        Some demons, however, are true believers in Lucifer's agenda to "cleanse" Earth, and actually consider themselves morally superior to humans.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are many ways of becoming a demon, from making a deal with a Crossroad Demon, to being a witch, and making a deal with another demon. They manifest on Earth in the form of a long, slender cloud of black smoke.
                        Once a soul becomes a demon, it gains the basic demonic powers (possession, superhuman strength, etc.) and from there, it can work its way up the ladder to positions of greater authority and power within Hell.
                        Often when a demon has used its powers, they leave a trace of sulfur in the nearby space, or if on a person, around the victim. This can give away the demon's presence, indicating to hunters that they are hunting a demon. Very powerful demons leave much more sulfur than average.
                        . Some demons are sent back to Earth to accomplish certain tasks, such as causing disasters, spreading diseases, assassinating hunters,
                        or manipulating people into committing crimes that will get them sent to Hell. To do this, they have to take a vessel or "meatsuit" in order to physically exist. While nearly all demons desire to escape Hell any chance they get, some demons actually prefer Hell,
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When they possess humans, they usually enter through their mouths. On one occasion, a demon entered a human via the eyes.
                        Possessed humans often look exactly the same as they did before possession, the only noticeable change being that their eyes will sometimes change color (black, red, white, grey, or yellow depending on the demon possessing them). Demon possession also causes a chemical change in the circulatory system of the host; demon blood is known to be a unique serum and has certain attributes when ingested.
                        Whenever they use their powers, they leave a trace of sulfur in the form of yellow dust. Angels and other supernatural beings can see the true faces of demons underneath their vessels.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Often under possession the human begins speaking and acting like the demon would. Upon exorcism, the human—if they survived—retains no memory of their time during possession (unless they have been "awake" during possession, in which case the time of possession is a nightmare for them, literally). The possessed humans also gain the powers of whichever demon is possessing them.
                        Unlike angels, whose possession of a human vessel has to be with the vessel's consent, demons forcibly possess humans. People suffering from stress, fear or panic can be vulnerable to demonic possession. Demons abhor the name of God (Christo), and will flinch and reveal the vessels black eyes if it hears the word.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Demons apparently cannot leave a host body if they are gagged by an encrypted gag.
                        Demons have no quarrel with killing or torturing their own kind to achieve their goals.
                        It is revealed that demons, although being tortured and twisted human souls, can be cured.

                    <p>Military Hierarchy of Demons</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>White-eyed Demons - These are Lucifer's second-in-the-command in terms of military, because they are the Hell's demon chiefs of staff.</li>
                        <li>Yelow-eyed Demons - These are the demon army generals</li>
                        <li>Red-eyed Demons - These are the demon deal-makers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Royal Hierarchy of Demons</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ruler of Hell - The King of Hell is the position and top title authority in Hell.</li>
                        <li>Princes of Hell - They are said to be the next at the throne of Hell, a claim matched only by one other demon, Lilith.</li>
                        <li>Ruler of the Crossroads - The King of crossroads is the position which is the Leader of all crossroads demons.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>White-eyed
                            <p>White-eyed demons are ancient demons, Lilith being the oldest of the demon kind. They're terrifyingly powerful and they rank the highest in the hierarchy of Hell acting as the demonic chiefs of staff of some sorts according to the writers.
                                 They inspire fear in their subordinates as all other demons seem to be terrified of them. Being as powerful as they are, they were resistant to many demonic weaknesses. They were even capable of holding their own against regular angels.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Princes of Hell/Yellow-eyed Demons
                            <p>The yellow-eyed demons are the Princes of Hell, the first generation of demons created after Lilith and the rightful rulers of Hell.
                                The four Princes are Azazel, Ramiel, Asmodeus and Dagon. Besides having a unique durability threshold and advanced telekinesis,</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Knight of Hell
                            <p>Knights of Hell are very powerful demons, said to be some of the first demons; handpicked by Lucifer himself, they were trained by Cain, the Father of Murder and himself the first Knight. Legend among Men of Letters had it that the archangels have destroyed all but one, but in truth Cain himself killed them.
                                Knights possess a number of abilities not seen from other types of demons. They are also nearly invulnerable, being resilient to many defenses against demons, including exorcism rites and even the demon-killing knife. The only weapon that can kill one is the First Blade.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Crossroads Demons/Red-eyed Demons
                            <p>Red-eyed demons, more called Crossroads Demons, are one level higher than black-eyed demons, and have more powerful abilities, such as teleportation and deal making. Since red-eyed demons have the ability to teleport, they are usually stationed as crossroad demons,
                                so they can teleport to the crossroads without having to be forcefully summoned. As crossroads demons, they make deals with humans, granting them one wish in exchange for their soul. In a period of time, normally ten years, a hellhound will be sent after the deal maker
                                and drag them to Hell, where they will become a demon. While stationed as crossroad demons, red-eyed demons generally possess attractive females, presumably to attract men to make a deal. If favored by the Ruler of Hell, or another higher demon, red-eyed demons can be promoted from a crossroads demon to a higher position.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Black-eyed Demons
                            <p>The most common and standard class of demons on the show, black-eyed demons possess only basic powers, such as possession, super strength and telekinesis. Effective defenses against these demons include holy water, salt, iron, a Devil's Trap, etc. Stronger black-eyed demons, such as Meg or the Seven Deadly Sins,
                                have more resistance such as not being barred from entering hallowed ground and one demon</p>

Unknown early versions of this ritual failed and ended up killing at least one, and presumably all 18 previous demon subjects.
                            When left unfinished, this ritual can leave the demon with human emotions and addiction to human blood for a while as seen with Crowley. This ritual has been proved to cure Black-eyed demons, high-tier Crossroad Demons, even Knights of Hell and as Sam Winchester states, "the lore doesn’t say anything about exceptions to the cure".
